The MacAdmins Slack Community became an important part of my technology journey soon after joining the [BetterIT Community](/projects/betterit). After joining the community few years ago I have been an active member and sometimes lead the leaderboards of the [#google-workspace](https://app.slack.com/client/T04QVKUQG/C08PZM3EX) channel with most replys/messages. Throughout my time in the community I have been greatful to learn form and contribute back to the community of increabile people. 

As part of the community I have learned stuff beyond my core work and ventured into account and device security.  Stuff I have never been able to do before.  The community enabled me to learn about processes, policies, and other core and side missions for ISO27001 certifications. 

As part of my contributions I have been able to create and foster connections to the most awesome IT admins and startups.

I am greatful for all the increable people in the community some of whom even turned customers of [22d consulting](projects/22dconsulting).
