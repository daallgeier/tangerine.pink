The BetterIT Slack Community is an extensive part of my technology journey. I joined the community a few years ago and have been an active member ever since. Throughout my time in the community I have been greatful to learn form and contribute back to the community of increabile people. 

I even met my awesome co-founder for [22d consulting](/projects/22dconsulting) Steve Larsen in the community.

While being part of this community I have been able to grow my skills from figuring out the answers to questions other people had and sharing my newly gained answers back to them.  It has been such a good way of learning about the small and big issues startups, corporates, and partners have.  I have been able to learn about the issues and solutions to problems that I would have never been able to learn about in my day to day work while also providing value back to the community. In the early days I have been pretending to be the sole IT admin for all the people in the community and thought of them as co-workers.

Getting pushed to install [gam](https://github.com/taers232c/GAMADV-XTD3) to becoming its greatest cheerleader has been quite quick and been enabled by this community.
