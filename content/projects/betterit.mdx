The BetterIT Slack Community was part of my technology journey. I joined the community a few years ago and have been an active member ever since. Throughout my time in the community I have been greatful to learn form and contribute back to the community of increabile people. 

I even met my increable co-founder Steve Larsen for 22d consulting in the community.
