With my involvement in other IT and Workspace communities ([BetterIT](/projects/betterit),[MacAdmins](/projects/macadmins), [C2C](/projects/c2c-community)) I have been invited to join the Google Cloud Community's Community Advisory Forum just before the relaunch of the community onto a new platform. 

We helped betatesting the new platform up until launch and are now helping to shape the community's direction through regular meetings and direct communication with the community leadership.
