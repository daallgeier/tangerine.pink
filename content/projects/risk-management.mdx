With ever increasing complexity it is important to understand the risks of your business and its operations.  

With this 4 day workshop in the Austrian alps we are offering leadership teams the ability to connect experiences by and with local mountaineers, pro athletes, and experienced paragliding pilots among other experts in risk and corporate management.  

Depending on weather and season your team will be spending time in the air with local pilots who will be showing you the valley from above while also pointing out risk management strategies they are making constant of while flying and working with passengers. 

Or you will be doing an avalanche or mountaineering course with professional mountain guides. 

Taking notes from the strategies learned in the mountain or the air we will then work with you in a workshop format to bring the learned strategies into the realities of business operations.  

In these workshops we will work together between the consulting team and the leadership team to bring in learnings from the day and compare them to challenges and potential risks in the business environment.
