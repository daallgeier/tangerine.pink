C2C Global the Google Cloud Customer Community is a place to connect, share, and learn from other Google Cloud customers. They invited me to be one of the first members of the community which is where I was able to shape the direction and content of the community. I was also able to help with the launch of the community and the first few events.

As a local team leader for the DACH region I helped organise and run events in collaboration with other team leaders, Googlers, and the C2C global team.
