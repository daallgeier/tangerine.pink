Back in 2015 I started to work within the refugee crisis in Europe. I was part of a small team of volunteers that started to organize donations, aid, and built popup campsites for refugees in need. We started to collect donations and drive them to the refugee camps on the balkan route. We also started to organize relief trips to the refugee camps in Greece and Turkey.  As part of [IHA](https://iha.help) (InterEuropean Humanitarian Aid) I started to work with team members from all over Europe. We worked together on the ground to deliver direct aid from the people for the people while also coordinating with local and international NGOs and organizations.  

During my time in refugee camps in Croatia I have been tasked with team leading, technology advancements, and orginsing and distributing donations. I have worked with the Croatian Red Cross, the Ministry of Interiour, the UNHCR, and mayn other organizations and volunteers to provide aid to the people in need.

While doing work on the ground I also enabled a team of about 30 volunteers in Germany and Europe to work together on the ground and remotely. This was accomplished through implementation of Google Workspace, Slack, and Trello while also training and educating users on these tools.  This lead to me buliding up a Google Workspace consulting business called [22d consulting](/projects/22dconsulting) which still runs today. 

After my involvement with IHA I was elected to be a member of the Board of [HERMINE](https://hermine.global) in 2018. I was part of the team working on reorganising and growing the new HERMINE and worked as a board member for 3 years (1.5 terms).  HERMINE is still doing great work in evolving crisis and disaster relief and I am proud to have been part of this team enabling it to scale to todays size.

# About HERMINE

HERMINE stands for: Help with first aid for people in need (or in German:  Hilfe zur Erstversorgung f√ºr Menschen in Not) and that is exactly our goal!

By providing a warehouse, HERMINE is bringing donations to where they are needed as sustainably and efficiently as possible. We also want to be there ourselves, where necessary, to support the people there.

As a non-profit organization, we position ourselves clearly against injustice and are committed to defending human rights. For us, this means standing up for the protection of weaker and needy people and thus ensuring that every person is treated fairly, equally, and humanely.

We organize both relief trips and aid deliveries in order to provide help as effectively as possible and to improve the situation on the escape routes.

# About My Work

As a board member I worked on technologic advancements, security ground work, and international remote collaboration on back office and frontline work in refugee camps and beyond.

During my 1.5 terms I worked with a team of 30 people in many different roles and positions to improve workflows, automate repatitive tasks, and enable team cohesion and collaboration.
