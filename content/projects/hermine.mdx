#About HERMINE

HERMINE stands for: Help with first aid for people in need (or in German:  Hilfe zur Erstversorgung f√ºr Menschen in Not) and that is exactly our goal!

By providing a warehouse, HERMINE is bringing donations to where they are needed as sustainably and efficiently as possible. We also want to be there ourselves, where necessary, to support the people there.

As a non-profit organization, we position ourselves clearly against injustice and are committed to defending human rights. For us, this means standing up for the protection of weaker and needy people and thus ensuring that every person is treated fairly, equally, and humanely.

We organize both relief trips and aid deliveries in order to provide help as effectively as possible and to improve the situation on the escape routes.

#About My Work

As a board member I worked on technologic advancements, security ground work, and international remote collaboration on back office and frontline work in refugee camps and beyond.

During my 1.5 terms I worked with a team of 30 people in many different roles and positions to improve workflows, automate repatitive tasks, and enable team cohesion and collaboration.
