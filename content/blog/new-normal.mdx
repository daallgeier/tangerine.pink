With nearly every company on this planet going to primarily working from home wherever possible people start to think about how the world is going to be after the mandatory stay at home orders are over.

Are we already living the new normal? Will Google Meet, Teams, or Zoom be the new primary ways to have meetings? Do we need this size of the office or can we down size? Are all those business travels really that important? And a lot of these questions come from many of the very conservative German SME leaders we talk to.

Being in the space of communication and collaboration, we at 22d consulting get those questions more and more often from customers, prospects, and partners. How can we make them work better? Especially during these times.

Questions arise around the viability of travel. The new found speed of chat based communication. The ability to save time and expenses from traveling — even if it’s just 5 kilometers for a 30 minute meeting. Why not move this to the cloud?

Yes, I think we are living the new normal already. It took a global pandemic at this level to change our perception of remote collaboration but we are ready. Societies are ready to embrace it in fear of catching a virus that may kill someone, many office jobs are ready to be done remotely, and the technology that enables all of this is easy and fast to acquire. Many experts claim that this situation will take up to two years to be safe again. But in these two years we will adapt because we have to. And two years is a long time to be than suddenly forced back into an office full time.

Don’t get me wrong: I miss my regular coffeeshop trip — but I also wouldn’t want to go to an office every single day just because I have to. I am more productive in my little home office or on the terrasse; I am better at collaborating with people when we use Google Docs and Asana; I am better at having phone conversations with customers and prospects when I don’t get distracted by the neighbour who yells into the phone (but who isn’t?).

So yes. I think we are living the new normal in business right now — it only took a pandemic to get us there.
