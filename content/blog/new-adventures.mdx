Starting as of October 1st, 2023, I am now pursuing a profession as a pro paragliding pilot.  

I have taken a sabbatical from my previous career as a tech founder, collaboration consultant, and sales person to pursue this new adventure.  I am excited to see where this takes me and what I can learn along the way.  I will be sharing my learnings and will combine them with previous work I did here on this [site](/blog) so you can learn with me!  I will also be posting shorts on my [Youtube channel](https://youtube.com/@daallgeier). Throught this adventure I am hoping to learn a few things on safety and security, sales and marketing, and of course paragliding!

I have given myself at least the next two years to be honing my skills on paragliding, skiing, and other adventures as well as public speaking, video production, and content promotion.  It'll be hard work, but I am excited to see where this takes me. 

Join me on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@daallgeier) and my other [Socials](/contact) and see where this adventure takes me!
