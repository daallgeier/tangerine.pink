After 8 years of working on 22d consulting with clients of 22d consulting and all our vendors it has become time for me to move on.   My body and mind are telling me to take a break from the daily grind of technology directing, consulting, and managing a company operationally.

I am very greatful for all the people on my team who worked with me on a lovable 22nd century and I am glad I was able to work in such a lovable work environment.  You all rock!
